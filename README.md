# Sort-Algorithm-Comp

A simple program that compares various sorting algorithms based on time-to-sort from smallest to largest. 

All tests are performed on a 256 element interger-array, with the numbers included in the array being randomly generated using C++'s ```rand()``` function, seeded with the current system time. Each sorting method begins with the same randomized array, to reduce other variables in time-to-sort.
