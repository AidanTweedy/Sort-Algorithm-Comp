# Sort-Algorithm-Comp

A simple program that compares various sorting algorithms based on time-to-sort from smallest to largest. 

All tests are performed on a 256 element interger-array, with the numbers included in the array being randomly generated using C++'s ```rand()``` function, seeded with the current system time.
